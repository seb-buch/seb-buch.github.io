NMR-depaker is really a small piece of software that can perform the so called "De-Pake-ing" procedure on a <abbr title="Nuclear Magnetic Resonance">NMR</abbr> spectrum.

It can also compute spectral moments and be used to convert <abbr title="Nuclear Magnetic Resonance">NMR</abbr> spectra (BRUKER format) to text files.
