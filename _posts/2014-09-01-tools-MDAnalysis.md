Disclaimer: I am not the author of MDAnalysis, just a mere contributor.

MDAnalysis is a great tool! It is more or less the Swiss Army knife every "<abbr title="Molecular Dynamics">MD</abbr> MacGyvers" need in their pocket!

It handles several file formats (GROMACS, NAMD, CHARMM...) and basically provides you a framework to help you with performing the analysis <i>you</i> need.

I told you it was a great tool!
