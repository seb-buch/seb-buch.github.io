Without membranes there would no cells so, quite obviously, they are an essential component of every single living organism.
Yet, their organization are not entirely clear and debates still exist concerning some aspects ("rafts" I am looking at you).
Because the vast majority of biologically-active molecules has to interact with biomembranes at some point (whether via a receptor/transporter or directly), it is very important to understand what happens.

Im my lab, our research is that field is focused on direct interactions between a molecule and the lipids from the membranes. Of course, a real biomembranes is a rather complex medium and it is hard to work with. This is why we use liposomes (Multi-Lamellar Vesicles) and vesicles (Small and Large Unilamellar Vesicles) as model membranes to investigate those molecules/membranes interactions.
 
The kind of molecules we are working with can vary from small molecules (glycolipids, antioxydants) to small peptides.

Our means is primarily <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>31</sup>P <abbr title="Nuclear Magnetic Resonance">NMR</abbr> to study lipid dynamics, but we also other methods such as <abbr title="Dynamic Light Scattering">DLS</abbr> / <abbr title="Static Light Scattering">SLS</abbr> and <abbr title="Electron Microscopy">EM</abbr>.
In addition to those experimental methods, we also use <abbr title="Molecular Dynamics">MD</abbr> simulations.
