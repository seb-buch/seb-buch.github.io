FATSLiM (<i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i><b>F</b>ast <b>A</b>nalysis <b>T</b>oolbox for <b>S</b>imulations of <b>Li</b>pid <b>M</b>embranes<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>) is a software dedicated to the analysis of trajectories of <abbr title="Molecular Dynamics">MD</abbr> simulations of lipid membranes.
The first goal of FATSLiM is to be fast (yeah, for real!), yet efficient and robust!

It is focused on the extraction of lipid-related physical parameters for the <abbr title="Molecular Dynamics">MD</abbr> trajectories (leaflet identification, thickness, area per lipid...).
Because it does not make any assumption regarding the topology of the membrane, it can works with wavy bilayers or even vesicles.
And, of course, it handles bilayers with a protein (or anything else) embedded in them.
